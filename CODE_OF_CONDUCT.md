# SSAR Code of Conduct

We want SSAR projects to be welcoming, safe, and collaborative spaces.  
All contributors, maintainers, and community members are expected to follow our [Open Source Code of Conduct](https://docs.ssar-group.com/legal/code-of-conduct?pr=opensoucre).

### Label Usage & Abuse Prevention

Labels such as **Urgent**, **Critical**, or any other high-priority classification must be used responsibly and only when the situation genuinely justifies it.

Misuse of critical or emergency labels — including exaggeration, repeated abuse, or intentional disruption — may result in moderation actions. These actions can include, but are not limited to:
- Temporary or permanent restriction of commit access
- Blocking of pull requests or issues
- Removal from contribution permissions
- Repository-wide bans in severe or repeated cases

This policy is strictly enforced to prevent disruption, misuse of maintainer attention, and unnecessary pressure on project workflows.

See [Code of Conduct - §40.1](https://docs.ssar-group.com/legal/code-of-conduct?pr=opensoucre&lnk=401)
